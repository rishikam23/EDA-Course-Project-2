# PM2.5 Emissions Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions data in the United States over the period 1999 to 2008, based on the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) dataset. The project explores various aspects of PM2.5 emissions, including changes in emissions by source type and geographic region.

# Files
Data: Contains PM2.5 emissions and source classification data (summarySCC_PM25.rds, Source_Classification_Code.rds).
R Code: R scripts that generate plots and analyze emissions trends.
Plots: PNG files with visualizations showing trends in PM2.5 emissions across different regions and source types.

# Project Questions
The analysis answers the following questions:
1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? 
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
